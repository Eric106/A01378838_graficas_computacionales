# A5 penguin-wobbling

Assignment No 5 for the computer graphics course. Using three.js, make a penguin walk using keyframes. Use the included OBJ file to load the penguin into a scene. The penguin must also be correctly facing the direction it is walking towards. Consider that penguins walk with a wobbling gait: they walk unsteadily balancing from side to side with every step they take.
